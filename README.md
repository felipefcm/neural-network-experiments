# Artificial Neural Network in Python

This is a simple project created to better understand how artificial neural networks, work.

This is heavily inspired by Michael Nielsen's book: [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).

Requires the MNIST database of handwritten digits at the root of the project:
- `./train-images-idx3-ubyte`
- `./train-labels-idx1-ubyte`

They can be downloaded from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
