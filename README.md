# Neural Network experiments

This is a simple project created to better understand how artificial neural networks, work.
It can use any MNIST-compatible dataset, such as handwritten, fashion, kmnist, etc.

The network implementation is inspired by Michael Nielsen's book: [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/).

There's also a PyTorch implementation, using both a simple NN with linear layers and a convolutional net.
